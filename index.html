                Pete's Party is an interactive story where you make the decisions for Pete and help him solve challenges along his way. You'll set his fate.
                <br>
                There will be a story part that will change the chapters depending on you choices. Each chapter is also linked to either a challenge or a choice that has to be made.
                <br>
                As you can see you have 10 hours until the party is over.
                <br>
            </p>

                The story begins...
            </h3>
            <p>
                Pete’s had a rough day and now, after meeting with the principal, he’s almost too late out of school to be able to make it to his best friend’s party. 
                <br>
                But maybe if he gets some help along the way he can make it.
                <br>
                How it ends is up to you...
                <br>
