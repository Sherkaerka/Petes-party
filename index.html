                The Game:
            </h3>
            <p>
                Pete’s had a rough day and now, after meeting with the principal, he’s almost too late out of school to be able to make it to his best friend’s party. 
                <br>
                But maybe if he gets some help along the way he can make it.
                <br>
                Are you in for the challenge?
            </p>
