            Chapter 1: Pick the lock!
        </h2>
        <p>
            As he steps out of the school building, he can see that place isn’t empty as he expected. Instead, the bus-stop is so overcrowded that the last bit of hope to make it to the party leaves him.
            <br>
            Pete sits down on the staircase, sobbing and feeling sorry for himself: “Look at this mess, why does this have to be the story of my life!?” 
            <br>
            Then he sees it, one lonely bike just standing there. It’s not his bike, of course, but maybe if he were just to have a look…
            <br>
            It’s locked…padlock…one could give it a try since everyone else is focusing on trying to climb the first bus approaching the stop.
            <br>
            <br>
